This repository hosts a Movie Recommendation System built in Python, designed to help you discover your next favorite film! Whether you're looking for something similar to what you've enjoyed before or want to see what others with similar tastes are watching, this system has you covered.
Features
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on their inherent characteristics (e.g., genre, director, cast, plot keywords). If you liked "The Matrix," our system can find other sci-fi action films with similar themes.
Collaborative Filtering: Leverages the collective intelligence of users.
User-User: Finds users with similar movie tastes to yours and recommends movies they enjoyed.
Item-Item: Identifies movies that are frequently liked by the same people, suggesting similar items.
Hybrid Approach (Optional/Future): Combines the strengths of both content-based and collaborative methods for more robust and accurate recommendations.
Data Processing: Utilizes pandas for efficient data cleaning, transformation, and preparation from common movie datasets.
Machine Learning Powered: Built with scikit-learn for core machine learning functionalities, including text vectorization, similarity calculations, and various model implementations.
Evaluation Metrics: Includes tools to evaluate the system's performance, helping to understand how well it's recommending movies.
